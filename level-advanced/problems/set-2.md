# Set of 10 Problems [11-20]

## Problems

### 11. Throttle Function

Write a function throttle(fn, wait) that returns a throttled version of fn, ensuring that itâ€™s called at most once every wait milliseconds.

### 12. Debounce Function

Implement a debounce(fn, delay) function. The function should delay the execution of fn until after delay milliseconds have passed since the last time it was invoked.

### 13. Event Emitter

Create a class EventEmitter that can register event listeners, emit events, and remove listeners.

### 14. Asynchronous Retry Mechanism

Write a function retry(fn, retries) that calls the asynchronous function fn, and if it fails, retries up to retries times before finally rejecting.

### 15. Flatten Deeply Nested Array

Write a function flattenArray(arr) that can flatten a deeply nested array of arbitrary depth, e.g., [1, [2, [3, [4]]]] becomes [1, 2, 3, 4].

### 16. Function Currying

Create a function curry(fn) that converts a function fn of multiple arguments into a curried version.

### 17. Async Parallel Execution with Limit

Write a function , limit) that takes an array and runs them in parallel, but no more at a time.

### 18. Memoization

Implement a memoize(fn) function that caches the result of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

### 19. Binary Search Tree Operations

Implement a BinarySearchTree class with methods to insert, search, and delete nodes.

### 20. Implement JSON.stringify

Write your own version of JSON.stringify() that can handle objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and null values.
