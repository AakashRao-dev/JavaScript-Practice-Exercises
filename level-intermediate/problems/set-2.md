# Set of 10 Problems [11-20]

## Problems

### 11. Sum of All Subsets

Write a function sumOfSubsets(arr) that calculates the sum of all subsets of a given array. For example, for [1, 2], the subsets are [], [1], [2], [1, 2], so the total sum is 6.

### 12. Implement Array Difference without filter()

Write a function arrayDiff(arr1, arr2) that returns an array of elements in arr1 that are not in arr2. Do this without using the filter() method.

### 13. Implement Array.prototype.map

Write your own implementation of the map() function that works similarly to Array.prototype.map(). It should take a callback function and return a new array with each element transformed according to the callback.

### 14. Implement Array.prototype.reduce

Write your own version of the reduce() function. It should take a callback and an initial value and accumulate the arrayâ€™s values based on the callback logic.

### 15. Frequency Counter

Write a function frequencyCounter(arr) that takes an array and returns an object representing the frequency of each element in the array.

### 16. FizzBuzz

Write a function fizzBuzz(n) that prints numbers from 1 to n. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

### 17. Flatten a Two-Dimensional Array

Write a function flatten2DArray(arr) that flattens a 2D array into a 1D array. For example, [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]] becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

### 18. Factorial with Recursion

Write a function factorial(n) that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.

### 19. Count Unique Values in Sorted Array

Write a function countUniqueValues(arr) that counts the number of unique values in a sorted array.

### 20. Reverse a String Recursively

Write a function reverseString(str) that reverses a string using recursion.
